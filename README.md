# ANPD-Auto-No.-Plate-Detection-

## Project Overview:
The project focuses on the development of an Automatic Car Number Plate Detection system utilizing OpenCV and EasyOCR. The objective is to accurtely detect and read vehicle license plates from images, for applictions in traffic management, security, and automated toll systems. 

## Technology Used:
--> OpenCV: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, used for image processing tasks such as plate detection, contour detection, and image manipulation.

--> EasyOCR: A robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library that simplifies the task of text extraction from images, specifically optimized here for recognizing alphanumeric characters on license plates.

## Key Features:
--> Image Detection: The system processes images locate and extract licence plates from moving vehivles.
--> High Accuracy: Utilizes image processing techniques to enhance the accuracy of plate detection and character recognition .
--> Scalability: Capable of handling various types of license plates with diffent style formats and styles. 

## Workflow:
1.   Image Acquisition: takes images of vechicles.
2.   Preprocessing: Applies filters and transformation to enhance image quality and isolate license plates.
3.   Plate Detection: Uses OpenCV to detect the contours and boundaries of license plates.
4.   Character Recognition: Employs EasyOCR to read and interpret the characters on the detected plates.
5.   Output: Dislay or logs the detected license plate information for further use.
